I threw this site together over a thanksgiving break when my girlfriend was out of state; it was around a time when I was trying to be healthy without paying an arm and a leg for it. Turns out veggies are cheap and *way* healthy. There's a ton of information online, it's a little confusing to take all of it apart so I started with a bunch of text files. I might add more here as I go, there's a little updates table below. 

##### Why .casa?
I used to own veggies.io; then I totally missed the renewal notices.
