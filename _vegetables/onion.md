Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup or onion chutney. They are very versatile and can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, saut√©ed or eaten raw in salads. Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked, facilitating stuffing them. Onions are a staple in Indian cuisine, used as a thickening agent for curries and gravies. Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack. These are often a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and The Commonwealth, usually served with cheese and/or ale in the United Kingdom. In North America, sliced onions are battered and deep fried and served as onion rings.
